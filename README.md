Hello 👋. Congratulation on successfully completing your first challenge 🎉 ! !

I have some recommendations regarding your code that I believe will be of great interest to you.

HTML 🏷️:

Use semantic elements such as <main> and <footer> to improve accessibility and organization of your page.
There is no need to wrap each element inside a div tag, with a single div element in the challenge is sufficient.
The text Improve Your Front-End Skills by Building Projects is considered a heading element (h1).
Instead of having an empty div to add space between elements, you can use the margin-bottomon the title or margin-top on the paragraph.
Alt text 📷:

The alt attribute should explain the purpose of the image. Uppon scanning the QR code, the user will be redirected to the frontendmentor.io website, so a better alt attribute would be QR code to frontendmentor.io If you want to learn more about the alt attribute, you can read this article. 📘.
CSS 🎨:

Do not use overflow: hidden on the html element, this will prevent scrolling on some devices ⚠️.
Instead of using pixels in font-size, use relative units like em or rem. The font-size in absolute units like pixels does not scale with the user's browser settings. Resource 📘.
Use min-height: 100vh instead of height. Setting the height to 100vh may result in the component being cut off on smaller screens, such as a mobile phone in landscape orientation. screenshot-imgur (landscape mode)📸
For better readability, consider changing the color of the paragraph element to a darker hue, such as hsl(220deg, 15%, 55%). This will increase contrast and make the text more legible against the background.
I hope you find it useful! 😄 Above all, the solution you submitted is great!

Happy coding!
